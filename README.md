# Eat Da Burger!
<hr>

* A full stack burger-logger web app featuring the use of Node, Express server, Handlebars for view generation and a homemade ORM. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data flow in the app. 

* The app itself is fairly straightforward but the focus here was to practice data flow, routing, view generation, etc., in a full stack design.

<hr>

# Technologies:

* HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars, MySQL, ORM, MVC.

* NPM Packages: express, method-override, body-parser, express-handlebars.

# App Functionality

* A fun app that lets a user input the name of a burger they want to eat.
Once submitted, the burger is displayed in text on the left side of the page where it's waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. Once clicked, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Every burger entered is stored in the database.
